    "1. Open each of the files in \"template\" and edit the \"Collection\" tab for each one as needed for the project.\n",
    "2. Run the makeCards script by double clicking it. This will take the templates, fill them with the text from the setEons.xml generated above, and save them under the \"new\" folder in Strange Eons.\n",
    "3. Move all the files in \"new\" to \"current\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### To add images:\n",
    "1. Open up a file in \"current\"\n",
    "2. Click on the Portrait tab\n",
    "3. From your computer, navigate to the imagesRaw folder and drag an image from there into Strange Eons to add it to the card.\n",
    "4. Within Strange Eons, move and scale the image as necessary.\n",
    "5. If it's an encounter card, do the same thing with the encounter set icon with the Encounter Set tab and the imagesIcons folder.\n",
    "6. Save the file, close it, and move on to the next.\n",
    "7. Note: If you do any modifications to the text, they will not be preserved by the next macro. Modifications to the text should be done only in the original Google sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To update text without messing up the images:\n",
    "1. Modify the Google sheet text.\n",
    "2. Run the above python cells to update the setEons.xml file. \n",
    "3. Run the updateCards script in Stange Eons by double clicking it. This will take the cards in \"current\", which should have images now, put in the updated text from the setEons.xml generated above, and save them under the \"updated\" folder in Strange Eons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To export the cards\n",
    "1. Make sure the \"Bulk Export\" Plug-in is installed.\n",
    "2. Right-click the \"updated\" folder, click on \"Bulk Export, choose the settings you want, and hit \"Export\"\n",
    "3. Once complete, copy all the files in \"updated\" to your imagesEons folder (the .eon file too if you want).\n",

    "### Important: Dealing with name, id, etc. changes\n",
    "Since the Card Number, Quantity, Name, and OCTGN ID all appear in the file name, any changes to these values will result in a desyncronization when trying to run updateCards. Here are the steps to follow in this case:\n",
    "1. In the \"current\" Strange Eons folder, manually fix the relevant file name.\n",
    "2. If your modification resulted in a longer filename, remove some \"-\" characters so that the total number of characters in the file name stays constant.\n",
    "3. Alternatively, if your modification resulted in a shorter filename, add extra \"-\" characters so that the total number of characters in the file name stays constant.\n",
    "4. Then, run the updateCards script."
